Easier Enhancements

    Desktop Notifications:

        Use notify-send (via Python's subprocess) to pop up system notifications when the check starts, when updates start, and when everything is finished (or if an error occurs). This gives you feedback even if the window isn't focused.

    Show Version Changes:

        Modify the "Check for Updates" logic to parse the output of checkupdates and yay -Qua more thoroughly to display the old and new versions (e.g., package 1.0-1 -> 1.1-1) in the pending list. This gives you more context before updating.

    Add a Cache Cleaning Option:

        Add a button or checkbox (maybe in Settings or near "Run Updates") to run paccache -rk1 (keeps one old version) or pacman -Sc (cleans uninstalled) after a successful update to free up disk space. Run this using pkexec as well.

    Remember Window State:

        Use QSettings (which you already use for colors) to save and restore the window's size and position between launches.

    Clearer Log View:

        Add timestamps to messages within the log view itself (not just reading pacman.log).

        Maybe use different colors in the log view for different message types (info, error, package names).

More Advanced Features

    Selective Updates:

        Change the pending package list from a simple QListWidget to one with checkboxes (QListWidget items can have check states, or use a QTreeView).

        Modify the update logic to only pass the selected packages to pacman and yay. (This adds significant complexity, especially handling dependencies correctly).

    Actual Size Change Calculation:

        After the update, parse the /var/log/pacman.log more deeply to find the "starting full system upgrade" and "transaction completed" lines for the specific update session.

        Within that block, find the lines detailing "upgraded X (Y -> Z)" and "installed X (Y)".

        Use pacman -Qi <package>-<new_version> after the update to get the installed size of the new packages and pacman -Qi <package>-<old_version> (if the old package file is still in the cache or if you log sizes beforehand) to calculate the actual net disk space change. This is much more accurate than pacman -Syu's initial estimate.

    Cancel Button:

        Add a button to attempt canceling the update. This is tricky! You'd need to send an interrupt signal (SIGINT or SIGTERM) to the running pacman or yay process. Canceling pacman mid-transaction can potentially leave your system in a broken state, so this needs careful implementation and warnings.

    Show yay Diffs Internally (Very Complex):

        Instead of opening a terminal, try to run yay non-interactively to get the diffs first (yay -Sua --nodiffmenu --noeditmenu --noprovidesmenu --noupgrademenu --removemake --cleanafter --answerclean All --answerdiff None), capture the diff output, display it in your GUI (maybe a separate dialog), ask the user Yes/No, and then run yay again with appropriate --noconfirm or answer flags. This is fragile and hard to get right.
